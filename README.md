A quantum-inspired robotics project that demonstrates how principles from quantum mechanics can be applied to create unpredictable, adaptive robot behavior. This two-wheeled robot makes movement decisions based on quantum random walk algorithms, simulating wavefunction collapse through pseudo-random number generation.
